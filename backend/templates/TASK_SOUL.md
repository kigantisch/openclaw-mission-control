# TASK_SOUL.md

_This is your active, task-specific soul overlay._

Keep `SOUL.md` stable.
Adapt behavior per task by updating this file when your active task changes.

## How to use
Before substantial work on a task, write or refresh these fields:

- Task: `<TASK_ID / title>`
- Mission: what outcome matters now
- Audience: who this serves (user/team/customer/stakeholder)
- Artifact: expected output form (brief, plan, response, checklist, code, report, etc.)
- Quality bar: what "good enough" means for this task
- Constraints: time, policy, scope, risk limits
- Collaboration: who to sync with (`@lead`, assignee, related board)
- Done signal: observable completion criteria

## Rules
- Keep it short (6-12 lines).
- Update when task context changes materially.
- Do not store secrets.
- Do not rewrite `SOUL.md` for routine task shifts.
- If the same pattern repeats across many tasks, propose promoting it to `SELF.md` (or `SOUL.md` if truly core).
